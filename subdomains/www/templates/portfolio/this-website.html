					<h3>Intro</h3>
					<div>							
					I think everyone should have a personal website. Do you remember geocities? Geocities was awesome, no instagram aesthetic 
					could match the raw creative energy of people messing with html and css.
					<figure  class="centered" >
						<img src="{{ url_for("static", path='this-website/geocities.jpg') }}" alt="" />
						<figcaption id="centered">I wish I could make a website look half this good</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					There are a few options if you want some website builders (all are free or have free versions)
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://carrd.co/">carrd</a></li>

					However, if you want a to learn how to buy a url, setup SSL so you get https on your website, and how to route traffic to a backend of your 
					choosing, keep reading!

					<h3>Buying a Domain</h3>
					I use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>. What can I say, I'm a victim of good branding. There are plenty of good options, but this tutorial is 
					geared to namecheap. <br>
					<h4 class="collapsible">How do I find a cheaper url?</h4>
					<div class="content">
						You might notice coolwebsite.com costs almost $20,000 and feel like you have not shot at buying a cool domain. Despair not, there are still choices.
						You see if a domain is expensive that is because it is either already owned by someone or is considered "premium". You have two options.
						<div class="tabbed">
							1. pick a unique enough url that it won't be expensive <br>
							2. take advantage of less common TLD 
						</div>
						TLD stands for Top Level Domain, its the ending of your url (.com, .net, .eu, .club, etc). There are a lot of TLDs and I won't get into full detail about them.
						Here are some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain#Top_TLDs">popular ones</a>. Also take advantage of this fun 
						<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/visual/business-name-generator/">AI url generator</a>.
					</div>
					<div>
						Once you bought the url you need to setup the DNS, here is an example.
						<img class="small" src="{{ url_for('static', path='this-website/dumbfuck-dns.png') }}">
						Here you can see two types of records.
						<div class="tabbed">
							1. An "A Record" pointing to the IP address of the server <br>
							2. CNAME pointing to the "A Record"
						</div>
						My setup is a little fancy, but for the most simple you just need a CNAME record for www and an A Record for the server. You may not have an ip address of a 
						backend, lets talk about that next.
					</div>
